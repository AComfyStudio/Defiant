This is the earliest stages of the project with prototype sprites and a simple testing layout. 

The current mechanics implemented are :
- Basic movement controls with arrow keys
- Basic jumping and gravity
- Dashing(Only works at an upwards angle) by pressing shift

Updates will be added shortly once basic mechanics are sorted out, note that there are collision errors present and movement is not completely refined.
